# Notes

- This solution doesn't take into account bank holidays
- What if the phone investment is outside UK working hours? Did it get made the next working day? - Assumption: investment made at exact date detailed
- Looked at the supplied table and wrote a test suite for it, checking what the results should be manually via [savvytime](https://savvytime.com/). Another approach would have been to write tests for the rules first, but I wanted to ensure I was directly testing the intended output
- Let's store dates as dates, not as 3 separate strings please ðŸ˜„
